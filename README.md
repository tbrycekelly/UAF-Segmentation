------

This tool allows for the segmentation of in situ footage of plankton imagery. The 
segment binary takes video files or images as inputs. The frames are flat-fielded 
using a vertical average and then regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted with 
the Maximal Stable Extrema Regions (MSER) algorithm. ROIs are segmented and their 
information saved (area, major_axis, minor_axis, etc) as the output of the program.

#### Setup

In order to build the project CMake 3.0.0, C++17, OpenCV 4.0.0, and OpenMP are all required.

This project has been successfully compiled with g++ 8.0+ on Ubuntu 20.04 and Centos 8.

To setup, first clone the repository.

```
cd Threshold-MSER
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```
Now the binary can be run.

```
./segment --help
```

####  Build Options

There are a few build options that can also be specified.  

OpenMP can be disabled with the WITH_OPENMP=OFF flag in cmake.
```
cmake -DWITH_OPENMP=OFF ../
```

Additionally, the segmentation process can be observed by using the VISUAL_MODE=ON flag in cmake.
*If the project is built with VISUAL_MODE=ON it will automatically set WITH_OPENMP=OFF.*
```
cmake -DVISUAL_MODE=ON ../
```

#### Quick start

The only required parameter of segment is the input parameter. This can either be a path to a 
directory containing video files, a path to a video file, or a path to a folder of images.
```
./segment -i <path/to/dir>
```

The segments that are produced can be controlled through several parameters. Most
notably, the --minium and --maximum paraters control the minimum and 
maximum size of a crop that can be extracted from a frame.
